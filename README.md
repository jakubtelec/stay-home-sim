# stay-home-sim

Advanced social distancing simulatior. Fight COVID-19, squash the curve. At home.

Check it [HERE](https://stay-home-sim.now.sh/).

### Inspiration

- [this article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/)

### Stack

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Ant Design](https://ant.design/)
- [p5](https://p5js.org/) <3 (particles movement simulation created on top of [this example](https://p5js.org/examples/motion-bouncy-bubbles.html))

### Additional things to do/to consider

- code cleanup
- mobile mode!
- manual control over simulation parameters (population, social distancing rate, speed rate e.t.c)
- optimizations (use home cooked canvas manipulations instead of f5, dynamic scaling)
- migration to hooks :/

### Additional things done

- spatial hashes implemented
